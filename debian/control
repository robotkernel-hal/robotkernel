Description: Modular real-time robotics framework.
 robotkernel is a modular real-time robotics framework for Linux-based 
 control systems. It provides the infrastructure for loading, executing, 
 and managing dynamically linked modules that communicate through shared 
 memory and trigger-based scheduling. Designed for hard-real-time industrial 
 use cases, robotkernel allows composition of complex automation pipelines 
 from reusable components.
