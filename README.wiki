= README.md for robotkernel =

'''robotkernel-5''' is an easily configurable hardware abstraction framework. In most robotic system assembly of robotic hardware components is a challenging task. With [[robotkernel-5|robotkernel-5]] the control engineer just has to write a bunch of simple and small configuration in [wp:YAML YAML].

= Components =

There are different structure in the robotkernel-5 framework called components.

== Bridges ==

act as inter-process communication bridge. usefull to provide communication with other applications e.g. links-and-nodes.

== Service Providers ==

provide a set of common services to the user ot gain the same expiriance for different attached hardware.

== Modules ==

usually the implementation of a hardware component/device driver. will provide process data, services, ....

= devices =

Each '''component''' may use robotkernel-5 internal devices to provide data to other components or to make inter-process-communication.

== process data ==

A process data device is used to provide cyclic-realtime data to other '''components'''.

== streams ==

Streams are usually used to supply a byte stream to other '''components'''

== triggers ==

A trigger is very useful, if the synchonization of different '''components''' is needed.

= services =

For some kind of Remote-Procedure-Calls there are the acyclic services.
